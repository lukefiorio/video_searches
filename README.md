# Automated Web Tasks
### YouTube video search and selection

This short project uses Selenium with Python to automate some simple web procedures.  We define a function that takes a search term and search result rank and plays the resulting YouTube video.

We then go a step further to call this function within a loop, searching for multiple videos (with distinct search terms) and playing each in a separate Chrome browser tab.
